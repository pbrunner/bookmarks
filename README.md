# bookmarks

A better looking way to see bookmarks from your web browser.

I want this to be a smooth and easy to use way to check all of your bookmarks. You can already see and sort your bookmarks in the web browser easily. It just doesn't look at nice as I would like. Eventually this will support:
- tags and filtering based on tags
- fuzzy search would also be nice but it's not super high on the priority list
- database to keep track of each entry and make it easy to add more, no need to edit the HTML
- themes, gradients are used throughout; choose the theme you want based on presets
